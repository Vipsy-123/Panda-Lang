# Panda Lang

Panda is a statically typed, compiled programming language that aims to balance simplicity and power. It was created with the following principles in mind:


## Features

## Tour of the Language

### 1. Variables

Variables are declared using the `let` keyword

```python
digit x = 2;
```

### 2. Data Types

Panda supports two datatypes: digit and string. String implementation is currently under devleopment.

```python
digit number = 27; 
string name = "Vishal"
```

### 3. Conditional Statements

You can use `if` and `else` for conditional branching.

```python
if(condition){
    //do something
}
else{
    //do something
}
```

### 4. Loops

panda offers both `for` and `while` loops.

#### For Loop

```python
for(var: Number i = 0; i<10; i = i +1 ){
      #code block
}
```

#### While Loop

```python
while(1){
    #code block
}
    # code block
```

### 5. Functions

Define functions using the `func` keyword. You can specify parameters and return types.

```python
digit add(digit x, digit y){
    return x + y;
}
```

### 6. Vectors and Map

Create vectors and map to store collections of data.
